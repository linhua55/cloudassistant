[![Build Status]][Travis CI] 

Numbers of fabric scripts to help build some services in cloud hosting fastly.

Install
-------

What you need to do is simply install fabric.

You can install it via pip(officially recommended) or easy_install(older, but still works fine)

`pip install fabric`

Or you may also opt to use your operating systemâ€™s package manager; the package is typically called fabric or python-fabric. 

`sudo apt-get install python-fabric`

*Warning:* Please DO NOT install it on windows. It would be a nightmare.

If you insist on installing it on Windows then you should read [one of my blog][1] to solve some Problem.

Usage
-----

`fab -f ./filename.py some_function`
